                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since 2013, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has led to an increase in China’s outward foreign direct investments (OFDI) and investment via Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in various sectors worldwide. While studies have shown BRI as a main driver for China OFDI growth, this paper examines its influence on other countries’ decisions to invest in BRI and non-BRI beneficiary countries. The research indicates China OFDI and M&A positively impact other countries’ investment in recipient nations, especially non-BRI nations.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since its 2013 launch, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has aimed to boost global trade through infrastructure investment. This paper assesses its impact on bilateral trade across aggregated and disaggregated sectors using a structural gravity model with 2006–2019 panel data. BRI membership increases trade with both BRI and non-BRI countries, especially in manufacturing, while services show no effect. Excluding China, intra-BRI trade rises across all sectors. We find positive trade creation in agriculture and manufacturing, but trade diversion in mining and energy. This study is the first to evaluate BRI’s trade effects at sectoral and multilateral levels.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> California’s strawberry nursery industry, which supplies nearly 90% of U.S. strawberries, faces growing challenges, including disease pressure, labor shortages, climate risks, and the phase-out of methyl bromide. This study combines a literature review with interviews to assess the potential of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) as a complementary tool to traditional open-field propagation. While CEA adoption in California remains limited, it offers benefits such as enhanced plant health, cleaner propagation, and greater climate resilience. Interviewees recognize CEA’s value in supporting nursery operations, though barriers like high capital cost, labor skill gaps, and limited economic data hinder broader uptake.

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) propagation technology offers a potential solution to several challenges facing California’s strawberry nursery industry. This study evaluates welfare impacts of CEA adoption using an Equilibrium Displacement Model (EDM) for a multistage strawberry market. Simulations with quasi-random sampling (Halton sequence) estimate changes in producer, consumer, and total surplus under varying CEA price and adoption scenarios. Results indicate that a 10% reduction in CEA plant prices decreases conventional producer surplus but increases CEA producer surplus, consumer surplus, and total surplus. Welfare gains grow with greater CEA adoption, highlighting its potential for industry-wide efficiency improvements.

                    Driving Under Pressure: Examining the Relationship Between Facility Detention and Truck Speed Patterns

                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> This study examines the relationship between truck driver detention, defined as delays over two hours at a facility, and driving speeds. Using GPS data and quantile regression, we find that detention is positively correlated with higher speeds among slower drivers. This association diminishes for faster drivers. Detention-related speed increases are most pronounced shortly after departure, raising safety concerns as some speeds exceed posted limits. While not causal, these findings suggest detention may be linked to risky driving behavior. Industry and policy responses aimed at reducing detention may support safer and more efficient freight movement.
